# CN Controls

When you download and import the package, you'll want to add some of the controls on
your scene. It uses the standard Unity UGUI system to display the controls, so to add
them in your scene, follow these two simple steps:
1. If you don't have a UGUI Canvas on your scene yet, add that using
GameObject → UI → Canvas menu items.
2. Drag any desired control from CNControls/Prefabs folder onto your Canvas.
That's it, you're ready to go.
(3). Optional step – tweak the controls position, it's parameters like axis names
and such.
The package contains five controls:
1. Joystick
2. Button
3. 4 Way D-Pad
4. 2 Way D-Pad horizontal
5. 2 Way D-Pad vertical
